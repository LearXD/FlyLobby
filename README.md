To use the plugin there is no secret, just have the pocketmine API `2.0.0` at hand, put the .phar version inside the `plugins` folder.

Then just turn on the server, and a configuration file will be generated, there you will find the following topics:

`fly-lobby-permission:` Necessary permission for the player to enter the server and the allowed world to have his fly activated!

`allowed-levels:` Here you will place all the worlds that the player will teleport to, he will be able to fly, if you set the parameter 'default' it will be replaced by the default world!
